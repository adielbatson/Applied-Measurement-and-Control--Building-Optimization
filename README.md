# Applied-Measurement-Control---Building-Optimization
As the urgency to mitigate and combat climate change grows, more and more solutions are required to forder a more sustainable world. On the radar for these solutions, energy conservation and consumption reduction techniques comprise a significant measure in realizing greater sustainability in home &amp; industry. However, one of the greatest limitations in realizing these developments is human contingent, for example forgetting to turn/off lights and heating. This project targets energy-use optimization by smart control of lights and heating use in prototye designed to simplify a room in a building.
